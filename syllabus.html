<h2>Grading Policies</h2>
<p>Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-.  The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. 
</p>
<p>Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. The curve is designed so that it will never lower your final grade (i.e. it can only help). The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the more generous the curve will be. 
</p>
<p>There will be no make-ups for homeworks or quizzes. 
</p>
<p>In order to reduce stress and to facilitate learning, we have two weighting schemes for the midterm and final exams. We will calculate each individual's final grade under both weighting schemes and pick the higher one for you automatically. Suppose you didn't do well on the midterm, all hope is not lost. You can make up for it in the final. 
</p>
<h2>Homework policy</h2>
<p>We will assign 1-2 homework problems every day. You are encouraged to attempt these problems on the same day that they are assigned. The homework problems for a given week are collectively due on the following Monday at noon on Sakai. Homeworks must be submitted in pdf format. If your submission involves any scans/photos of handwritten homework, make sure your handwriting is clear and legible. 
</p>
<p>There will 6 homework assignments. The lowest homework score will be dropped. 
</p>
<p>Each homework question is graded on a 0-4 scale. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you get everything correct (up to some minor typos/careless mistakes), you get a 4. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you get almost everything correct but made a crucial mistake somewhere, you get a 3. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you get the general idea or strategy right, but are missing some components here and there, you get a 2. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you gave the problem a reasonable attempt, you get a 1.  
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don't attempt/submit the problem you get a 0. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Late work will receive no credit. The homeworks are turned in on Sakai. The grades for these are on Sakai under Gradebook. 
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>The midterm and final exams are online examinations that last 70 minutes each (allocate 60 minutes for completing the exam, 10 minutes for printing and uploading the exam on Sakai). They are open-book and open-notes, but you are not allowed to consult any person (other than the teaching staff of this course) or the internet during the examination. More details will be announced in class. 
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>The quizzes will be completed at the beginning of class every day via Sakai. 
</p>
<p>The daily quizzes consist of around around 3 to 5 simple and quick conceptual True or False and multiple choice questions. They are meant to help you assess your own conceptual understanding of the materials, so that you can identifiy any weaknesses and rectify them immediately. They are graded based on completion. As long as you show up to class everyday and give a reasonable effort at the quizzes, you will receive full credit. 
</p>
<h2>Math Help Room</h2>
<p>The Math summer help room will be up and running starting Wednesday, May 11th and running through June 22nd.   The help room provides drop-in tutoring for all students taking math courses this summer.  There are four help room TAs. Two will be in person in 150 Physics, and two will hold their hours via Zoom.  The schedule is attached below.

Further, all members of the University community have a responsibility to uphold these values and actively foster full participation in university life.”

<p>Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Student Disability Access Office at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be made.Excused Absence Students who miss graded work due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday or short-term illness should fill out an online NOVAP, religious observance notification or short-term incapacitation notification form respectively. If you are faced with a personal or family emergency or a long-range or chronic health condition that interferes with your ability to attend or complete classes, you should contact your academic dean’s office. See more information on policies surrounding these conditions here, and your academic dean can provide more information as well.
</p>
<h2>Regrade requests</h2>
<p>Regrade requests must be made within three days of when a report is returned. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel part of your report is correct, but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for an issue. When a regrade request is evaluated, if new errors are identified, additional points may be deducted from the grade. The last day to file a grade change request is June 21.</p>
